## Coding Practices

1. Used react hooks: it holds abstract logics and reduced syntax
2. Every component can be reused in different views
3. Used CSS in Javascript (otherwise will prefer to use SCSS)
4. Index.js file used as the default file of the particular folder
5. Take card of naming conventions
6. Use ES-Lint to maintain the code quality
